# TFM-DL-interpretability-and-image-segmentation
Github repository containing the necessary code for the elaboration of the Master's Thesis at UPC.

This project is dealing with 4 different datasets:
  - MNIST
  - LFW (Labeled faces in the wild)
  - NT (nuchal translucency images, fetal ultrasound images)
  - CRL (crown-rump length images, fetal ultrasound images)

Every dataset has its own notebook. NT and CRL have additional notebooks for data augmentation. CRL has an additional notebook for adding some modifications to the images. 
MNIST has an additional notebook for adding some perturbations.
